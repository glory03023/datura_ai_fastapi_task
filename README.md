# Datura AI FastAPI Task

This project is a FastAPI-based web service that utilizes various machine learning and AI components. The app is designed to serve as a starting point for building scalable APIs with FastAPI, Poetry, Docker, and other Python-related technologies.

## Features

- FastAPI backend for efficient API handling
- Poetry for dependency management and environment management
- Docker for containerization
- Handles interactions with `bittensor` for decentralized AI models (if relevant to your project)
- Exposes endpoints for interacting with machine learning models or APIs

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Poetry for managing dependencies
- Docker (if containerized deployment is desired)
